Removes the 'News' section from the Wikipedia homepage

I really enjoy having Wikipedia's Main Page as my homepage in Chrome. There's always some weird fact or piece of history to learn about. It's probably not great for productivity, but it's worth  it.

One issue is that I don't want news headlines on my homepage. A bit of news is important, but too much of it is noisy.

This is me mucking around with Chrome plugins and javascript (for the first time) to try and remove the news.
